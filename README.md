# Donate

Hello ðŸ‘‹, my name is Eduardo but you can see me around as _posva_.

I really enjoy building projects and sharing them with the world hoping they are useful to others as well. When I do this I do not expect anything but as much as I enjoy building and releasing stuff, I have to pay my bills as any other person. And, like most people, I look for jobs to pay them ðŸ˜„. Which means I do all the Open Source in my Free time, as a hobby.

By making a donation, no matter how small, you are saying thanks and drawing a smile on my face because I will know, somebody thought my project was useful and worth paying for ðŸ¤©.
